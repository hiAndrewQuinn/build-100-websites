    <h1>Build 100 Websites!</h1>
    <p>Howdy! The name's Andrew Quinn. I'm building 100 websites!</p>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It seemed like fun!</p>
    <p>
      I've been a computer guy for a long time, but even as a little kid I
      always saw building websites as this immensely daunting task that only a
      genius could pull off. Then I got a little older and got a computer of my
      own, and as the years went by it gradually began to appear like a less
      daunting task to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pretty much went through every phase of Unix geekdom you can imagine
      before, at the ripe age of 28, I finally admitted to myself "I just think
      websites are cool and I want to build some." Let's see, we have:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Linux distro enthusiast phase.</li>
      <li>The Emacs enthusiast phase.</li>
      <li>The ANSI C enthusiast phase.</li>
      <li>The Haskell enthusiast phase.</li>
      <li>
        The bare metal enthusiast phase. (This one pushed me through a
        bachelor's in electrical engineering!)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      And here we are. Currently I work in the ops department of a very cool
      fintech firm, and I'm actually quite happy with that role -- but here's my
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heiandrewquinn/">LinkedIn</a> and my
      <a href="https://github.com/hiAndrewQuinn/">GitHub</a> profile anyway ;)
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I might be the world's slowest maturing web developer, since I got
      my first job in tech in 2009 as a Linux sysadmin intern at Akamai and just
      kind of never stopped messing around with Linux until it accidentally
      became my full-time career. But for some reason, I was always terrified of
      making the leap into <em>real</em> dev work - what if I'm not smart
      enough? What if I can't build the product fast enough? What if it's just a
      bubble?
      <span style="color: white"
        >(Yes, I was actually asking myself this about software in
        <em>2020</em>. Trauma is one motherfucker of a

    <p>
      That's right, this right here is website #1! Its primary purpose is simply
      as a <strong>technique catalogue</strong> of how I went about doing
      everything, what big technologies I used, etc. It is
      <em>unapologetically</em> self-indulgent that way.

    <h4>Plain ol' HTML</h4>
    <p>Ha, it's 2023 and I wrote all the HTML for this little page by hand!</p>
    <p>
      But it's good to get back to basics every now and then. I mean
      <em>really</em> basic - I've had a lot of fun nights in my life reading
      old websites that looked not too dissimilar at all from this, straight up
      Web 1.0. My favorites are when you find a professor's website that looks
      like it might as well be the inspiration for
      <a href="https://danluu.com">danluu.com</a> but then you realize it's
      <em>also</em> the page of one of

        I could have made something more of myself.)</span

    <h4>nginx</h4>
    <p>
      I actually have
      <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=superkuh">superkuh</a> to
      thank for this choice. After my
      <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34958454"
        >first ever Hacker News submission to hit the front page</a
      >, they left
      <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34959053">a comment</a>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        You can just write HTML too. It is much simpler, easier to maintain, and
        more secure (using a real webserver). Make .html files, open them in a
        text editor, type in the HTML. Here, I'll make an example like the
        minimum viable hugo.
      </p>
      <pre> $ sudo apt get install nginx </pre>
      <pre>
 &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt; Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet &lt;title&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt; Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet &lt;h1&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;html&gt; </pre
      >
      <p>
        And now save it as index.html in the www directory that installing nginx
        creates. Check it out at http://127.0.0.1/ . Go to your router and
        forward port 80 to the IP address of the computer running nginx to make
        it public.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Hey, it looked simple enough. So I tried it out. And it worked! And it was
      actually really fun and satisfying!
    </p>
    <p>
      Working in ops I definitely knew of <code>nginx</code> for a long time,
      but it always sounded like the kind of thing that was just a little too
      low-level for me to bother with. I think I wasn't giving it enough credit
      - it's quite an improvement on Apache in terms of usability. Realizing I
      could literally just install it, stick an <code>index.html</code> into the
      <code>/var/www/html/</code> it created, and then see it in Firefox has
      changed my tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one small problem, and that's that
      <code>nginx</code> doesn't use UTF-8 by default. So my ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ looked
      like a much more menacing Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ until I figured out how to do
      that:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        First find and open <code>nginx.conf</code>.
        <ol>
          <li>
            Any time I have to edit a random config file on a Linux box these
            days, I just mindlessly hammer out
            <code>sudo vi $(fdfind . '/' | fzf)</code> and fuzzy-search until I
            find the boy; it's a lot easier than trying to use my
            half-remembered knowledge of the
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard"
              >FHS</a
            >
            to track them down.
          </li>
          <li>
            in this case, it looks like it was living at
            <code>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</code>.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Then find the <code>http</code> block and add
        <code>charset utf-8;</code> to it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, run <code>systemctl reload nginx.service</code> and take a
        look! No more weird characters.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>entr</h4>
    <p>
      There was of course one annoyance even with this bare-bones setup: I
      didn't want to have to actually <em>edit</em> this page at
      <code>/var/www/html/</code>, since that's owned by root. Half the reason I
      love sites like <a href="http://netlify.com/">Netlify</a> is because I can
      just set them up to rebuild any time I hit <code>git push</code>. And
      <code>nginx</code> doesn't come with live reload, like Hugo does.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I installed an auto tab reloader extension for Firefox and set it to
      every 5 seconds, a poor man's live reload, but easy enough; and then I
      installed <code><a href="https://github.com/clibs/entr">entr</a></code
      >, a <em>magical</em> little utility that runs a shell command whenever a
      given file changes. (Seriously. If you've never used this thing before
      keep it in your back pocket. It is a game-changer when working on web
      stuff like this, up there with <code>watch</code> in a
      <code>tmux</code> window.)
    </p>
    <p>I went to my <code>build-100-websites</code> repo, punched in</p>
    <pre> echo index.html | sudo entr cp index.html /var/www/html </pre>
    <p>and we were off to the races!</p>
    <h4>Github Pages (hosting)</h4>
    <p>
      Now superkuh was kind enough to give me port forwarding instructions, but
      I didn't want to pay for a whole VM just to put one HTML page online. At
      the same time, I had used Netlify and Heroku for everything of this sort
      my whole life, and I decided I wanted to try out GH Pages to see what all
      the fuss is about. I had the literal HTML sitting there, in Github - it
      was even called <code>index.html</code> for crying out loud. How hard
      could it be?
    </p>
    <p>
      Not hard at all, it turned out! Getting it to deploy on
      <a href="https://hiandrewquinn.github.io/build-100-websites/"
        >https://hiandrewquinn.github.io/build-100-websites/</a
      >
      was as close to a zero-config hosting experience as I've ever seen: Pick
      your branch, make sure the HTML page is named "index", and you're good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting it to deploy on
      <a href="https://build-100-websites.fun"
        >https://build-100-websites.fun</a
      >
      was a little more involved, by necessity, since you have to set up your
      CNAME and ALIAS tags and everything for a DNS provider. First GH Pages
      commits a new
      <a
        href="https://github.com/hiAndrewQuinn/build-100-websites/blob/main/CNAME"
        >CNAME page to the root of your Git repo</a
      >
      containing the name of your website, as per
      <a
        href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain"
        >the instructions</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also finally got an opportunity to use <code>dig</code>! I've wanted to
      use <code>dig</code> ever since I read this
      <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/12/04/how-to-use-dig/"
        >Julia Evans article about it</a
      >.
    </p>

      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      I know, I <em>know</em>, you were expecting me to go for Hugo for #2. But
      no! At work, I happened upon some CSVs generated by some legacy code that
      I figured woud be <em>really</em> helpful to be able to access whenever I
      was on the corporate network, instead of rummaging around in my email to
      find them ('legacy' here means, in part, that these CSVs get created and
      mailed out to 5 or 6 people every day).
    </p>
    <p>
      I've used Simon Willison's
      <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> many times before in the
      past and found it a simply remarkable little piece of software. I love
      SQLite, I love locally-hosted web apps, I love performance - what's not to
      love, really? But alas, the published guides on deploying Datasette all
      focus on <em>public</em> platforms: Google Cloud, Vercel, Fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I happen to work primarily in enterprise, and with Microsoft Azure in
      particular. And I think there's a <em>really</em> nice niche for creating
      tiny baked-data websites for company eyes only - so I decided to get some
      practice at home deploying Datasette to Azure on my own time. Just to make
      sure I knew what I was doing for the big time. ;)
    </p>
    <h3>Getting Azure set up</h3>
    <p>
      I've never used Azure in a <em>personal</em> capacity before, despite
      being a cloud administrator. So I treated this quite a bit differently
      from how I usually provision resources on the job, namely: I aggressively
      cost-optimized.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Every time I performed a command, which I did entirely in the Azure
        Cloud Shell, I looked through the portal to find the
        <em>exact</em> thing I created. I wanted to be able to keep mental track
        of it all.
      </li>
      <li>
        Every time I came across a new feature that was mentioned, I made a few
        quick Anki flashcards asking me what it was and what it could give me.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Following Simon Willison's instructions, I created my resources in the
      order Resource Group, Storage Account, Function App. I actually really
      like the simplicity of this stack - it's similar to working solely with
      Lambdas and S3 in Amazon Web Services. Easy to keep track of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the bugs! Unsurprsingly Mr Willison does not spend as much time
      in Azure land as me, and so his codebase was slightly out of date. The
      instructions weren't clear-to-the-point-of-brainless, either, so I added a
      few bits of my own to that.
      <a href="https://github.com/hiAndrewQuinn/datasette-on-azure"
        >Here's the results!"</a
      >
    </p>
    <h3>The cost of getting set up</h3>
    <p>
      After an evening or two of messing around with it, I finally got my Azure
      Function to work right! I was serving an honest-to-goodness serverless web
      app, and it wasn't even hard! For a while I loved living on the shoulders
      of giants... Until I saw <em>the bill.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>One cent.</strong> One whole cent a day. That's how much my little
      experiment was costing me, and it was entirely from storage costs. I
      couldn't believe it! I had an actual bill that wasn't from a DNS provider,
      for the first time in my life!
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew from my work that storage is one of those bugbears you absolutely
      want to keep an eye on when running any kind of software busines, because
      if you're doing things right (aka collecting a lot of data), it will only
      grow over time - and you'd better make sure you can afford that. I found I
      had on the order of 50 megabytes in blob containers for my serverless
      SQLite database searcher, alongside about 3 MiB of tables and 6 KiB of
      file shares. At current prices of $0.15 per GB, this would have explained
      the approximately one-cent-a-day storage costs I saw. In other words, I
      could reliably bet on an average SQLite database, infrequently acceessed
      and under, say, 10 MB of data to cost about 50 cents a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      I figured this was pretty acceptable, actually, because I had another idea
      brewing...

    <h3>Hugo to the rescue</h3>
    <p>
      So it won't surprise any of you to learn that I have long been a fan of
      <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>, especially how it can turn
      Markdown files into HTML files. Did you know that you can make
      <em>entire websites</em> like that!? Whoaaaaa. This kind of pandoc-plus
      software is usually called a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator"
        >static site generator, or SSG,</a
      >
      and there are even
      <a href="https://jamstack.org/">buzzwords around it</a> for people who
      like making money off of that kind of thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      SSGs are cool because sometimes a little abstraction is a good thing. Yes,
      we all love raw HTML around here 😼 but let's be real, if you're going to
      start maintaining significant amounts of actual content, you might want
      something that can get out of your way a little more. Ultimately I chose
      <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> as my SSG - I figured I only really
      needed to learn one, and while Hugo had a reputation for a difficult
      learning curve, I figured I could amortize that coist against all future
      sites I built with the site. (Sitting here in August 2025, I'd say I was
      right!)
    </p>
    <p>
      SSGs are cool because when you take the database out of the mix entirely,
      and only want to serve HTML, CSS, and maybe the lightest buttering of
      JavaScript (which I didn't even get around to on this site until like
      summer 2025) they can usually be literally free to operate. Like,
      seriously, you'd have to be some kind of idiot to screw up e.g. optimizing
      your GIFs so that you don't accidentally have your static site go viral on
      Hacker News and be buried by server bills...
    </p>
    <h3>I go viral on Hacker News and get buried by server bills</h3>
    <p>
      Oops.
      <a href="https://andrew-quinn.me/fzf/">https://andrew-quinn.me/fzf/</a>,
      published less than two months after I started the site, goes
      <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35248098"
        >bonkers viral on Hacker News</a
      >
      and about a week later I learn
      <a href="https://andrew-quinn.me/azure/"
        >just how Netlify, my hosting provider, made its bones.</a
      >
      In retrospect, $100 and change is an <em>incredibly cheap</em> amount to
      pay for that particular learning experience, and I promptly decided to
      actually use all of that Azure cloud knowledge I had accumulated working
      at
      <a href="https://nomentia.com/"
        >the best cash management company in the Nordics</a
      >
      to future-proof myself with an Azure Static Web App.
    </p>
    <p>
      Success! I have never had another post from AQDM go remotely as viral as
      that first one, but if it ever happens again I will be ready.

    <h3>Slouching towards the Long Now</h3>
    <p>
      My life gradually got busier after 2023. I switched jobs to a senior
      position at another company, and this tiny digital cottage of mine
      languished with barely any content since then. Virtually nothing on the
      blog actually happened in 2024. Virtually nothing on the blog actually
      happened in 2024. A second burst of activity in 2025 while I was on paid
      parental leave with my firstborn child led me to have to face the facts: I
      really wanted a digital home, but I didn't have much of a clue for what I
      would actually want to <em>do</em> there.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I decided, ultimately, that this was going to be a slim,
      slowly-updating website about <em>me</em>, as a personal human being. I
      have other websites now for any technological work I want to publicize; I
      want this website to slowly grow into a sprawling morass of essays and
      personal reflections, that the reader can walk away from thinking about
      things in a new light. (I am very, very far from that goal, but that is my
      intention!)

    <h3>A home for little things</h3>
    <p>
      I learn a lot of new things every day! And not all of it is a great fit
      for Anki, or even for keeping in my brain permanently. Around the tail end
      of 2023, I began to realize that the only thing better than keeping a
      notebook in the open is keeping a notebook in the open which LLMs can
      slurp up and regurgitate back to me conveniently right when I need it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to make writing a new TIL as frictionless as possible, so that I
      would actually do it. I knew it would always be a little heavier weight
      than a Tweet, but it didn't have to be <em>much</em>! I wrote a simple
      shell script that lets me open a terminal, type <code>til</code>, and
      immediately jot down whatever I just came across. This website is the
      result of that script. It's a collection of short-form articles on a wide
      range of topics, from
      <a
        href="https://til.andrew-quinn.me/posts/binary-search-isn-t-about-search/"
        >binary search algorithms</a
      >
      and
      <a
        href="https://til.andrew-quinn.me/posts/you-don-t-need-cgo-to-use-sqlite-in-your-go-binary/"
        >Go programming</a
      >
      to
      <a
        href="https://til.andrew-quinn.me/posts/language-learning-treated-as-breadth-first-search/"
        >language learning</a
      >
      and thoughts on
      <a
        href="https://til.andrew-quinn.me/posts/beware-those-who-promise-increasing-marginal-returns/"
        >diminishing returns</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole workflow is optimized for speed from my end. I wanted as little
      friction as possible between having a thought and publishing it. One of
      the really neat things that came out of this was a script to promote tag
      reuse - before I write anything, a script scrapes all the tags from
      existing posts and uses <code>fzf</code> to present me with a multi-select
      menu, making it easy to build up true "breadcrumb trails" for readers to
      follow over time. No more of this "my blog has 500 tags and all of them
      are used exactly once" nonsense!
    </p>
    <h3>Speed kills</h3>
    <p>
      I would eventually adapt a similar shell-based workflow with AQDM to make
      popping off posts there easier, but - even though I should have known
      better - I held off until summer 2025 to do it. That's partly why there
      are so many more posts over on TIL than on my actual site, beyond just the
      medium itself being different.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing I would really like to try is a script which shows me one random
      post from my own TIL's backlog, just so that I can remember it and decide
      on whether or not I want to revisit it. Many of the best ideas are reached
      by elaborating on previous riffs.
    </p>
    <h3>Fun with <strike>group</strike> Github Actions</h3>
    <p>
      For such a simple blog, it has a ... <em>sophisticated</em> automated
      deployment pipeline. Look, at heart I'll always be a freakly little
      sysadmin, and I'm allowed to experiment in my off time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anytime I save a new post, a local Git hook triggers a GitHub Action,
      which in turn updates a second repository that contains the Hugo site,
      which triggers <em>another</em> GitHub Action to build and deploy the
      final website.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's mostly no good reason to do it this way. That is to say, there is
      exactly one good reason to do it this way:
      <strong
        >Anyone can just plug an unordered stack of Markdown files in and get a
        fully-configured TIL website out.</strong
      >
      This idea was so exciting to me for about 5 minutes that I even
      <a href="https://github.com/siilikuin/rabbitholer"
        >spun up a new repo under my DBA</a
      >
      to pursue it before I realized how much of a waste of time that would be.
      Wasn't I <em>just</em> saying "I bothered to learn Hugo so I could
      amortize its cost over all future static websites"? What am I doing
      writing, in effect, my own specialized SSG <em>over</em> Hugo?
      Nevertheless, if you want to try it out, give it a whirl!
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a bit Rube Goldberg, but it's been a fun way to experiment with
      automation. It was originally hosted on a generic GitHub pages domain but
      was moved to its current, snazzier home at
      <a href="https://til.andrew-quinn.me/">til.andrew-quinn.me</a> in August
      2025.

    <h3>Automatically scraping the news</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://yle.fi/selkouutiset"
        >YLE Selkouutiset (Finnish for "Clear News")</a
      >
      is probably the single highest-quality source of <em>selkosuomi</em> on
      the Internet. Every single day, about 500 words of professionally written
      and reviewed Finnish about topical events just ...<em>appears</em> on the
      Finnish equivalent of the BBC - and then it's gone! Oh, sure, you can
      still find all of the pages, but maddeningly there is no way to guess what
      the URL for, say, the 2024-08-21 clear news would be. It's just not how
      they organize things.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew I had to intervene. For my own sake, and for the sake of everyone
      else learning this language. My first big break was realizing that pandoc
      could pretty effortlessly slice through whatever JavaScript YLE seems to
      build their actual news sites off of, which meant a
      <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/"
        >simonw-style daily Git scrape</a
      >
      could easily give me the raw fodder I needed to compile this codex myself.
      I set to work.
    </p>
    <h3>A sysadmin's lament</h3>
    <p>
      In 2023, I still wasn't totally confident that I had what it took to be A
      Software Developer (TM), working in Real Programming Languages. So instead
      of using anything approaching a sane deployment method, I used shell
      scripts. Shell scripts in a
      <a href="https://fishshell.com/">lovely, but nonstandard shell</a>. Much
      later on I finally
      <a
        href="https://github.com/hiAndrewQuinn/selkouutiset-scrape-cleaned/blob/master/process.sh"
        >refactored my previous monstrosity</a
      >
      into one single, POSIX-approved, monster of a shell script, which did
      <em>not</em> attempt to overengineer the problem. This has proven to be
      <em>much</em> simpler to debug, and <em>much</em> more sparing on my
      Raspberry Pi's system resources.
    </p>
    <h3>Wait, Raspberry Pi?</h3>
    <p>
      Oh! Didn't I tell you? This was the first project I ever took on that uses
      a dedicated bit of hardware that I personally own as a tool. As we speak,
      a tiny Raspberry Pi is running a copy of
      <a href="http://tinycorelinux.net/">Tiny Core Linux</a>,
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions_that_run_from_RAM"
        >entirely out of RAM.</a
      >
      Why is this a big deal? Because SD cards are expensive, and the 2 years I
      would get out of one I have to write a little bit to every day probably
      goes up to more like <em>20</em> years if I only ever have to read from it
      once a <em>month</em> when I power cycle the little box.
    </p>
    <p>
      This makes the traditional engineer part of my brain, which loves to think
      in logistics and resource constraints and consumption of scarce goods,
      very, very happy. The fact that operations on an entire filesystem sitting
      in RAM are incredibly fast is just part of the fun. But I didn't start out
      with Tiny Core Linux; I started out on ordinary Debian and just tried to
      minimize write cycles by ... minimizing the number of times we poll our
      Git repos to actually build the website. (Yeah, that wasn't the best
      option.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TCL doesn't have the Fish shell in any format I care to consume. And
      RAMdisk-based compute is awesome, but it also comes with the necessary
      constraint that even the programs you install onto it are eating
      significant chunks of your 4 GB or what have you. So ultimately the switch
      to TCL forced me to rework my brittle little Fish shells into a lean,
      mean, 0ms startup time machine of the
      <a href="https://busybox.net/">BusyBox shell</a>. Yeah - not even Bash. We
      are going ALL the way back. But when the work was done, my data cleaning
      pipeline broke a whole lot less often, and I could leave the Pi going for
      much longer without any major issues, and virtually any major issue that
      remained could/can at least temporarily be patched over by just turning it
      off and on again.
    </p>
    <h3>Actions, Github Actions everywhere</h3>
    <p>
      The real magic of this project is its automation. The commit log is a
      testament to this, with endless "Auto-update content submodule" messages.
      A GitHub Action runs daily, scraping the latest articles from YLE and
      dumping them totally unaltered into
      <a href="https://github.com/hiAndrewQuinn/selkouutiset-scrape"
        >a scrape repo.</a
      >
      I don't think I've had to manually touch this first repo since I started
      it up; and yet having the canonical data here in a practically-immutable
      form was pure gold for the other two steps of the pipeline.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/hiAndrewQuinn/selkouutiset-scrape-cleaned"
        >An intermediate repo</a
      >
      actually runs our Pi-based data cleaning on a regular pipeline, and this
      can take a few minutes (mostly because I intentionally tried to avoid
      optimizing the heck out of it for a "stateless" feeling script). .
    </p>
    <p>
      Then finally this cleaned up repo as a submodule is then pulled into the
      <a href="https://github.com/hiAndrewQuinn/selkouutiset-archive"
        >actual Hugo site</a
      >, which is rebuilt and deployed automatically. It’s a completely
      hands-off process that ensures the archive is always up-to-date.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Github Actions? Git submodules? Sounds an awful lot like your TIL
      pipeline." And you're right! It's an elaboration on that first idea. This
      project was my first deep dive into using submodules with Hugo and setting
      up a more complex, multi-repository CI/CD pipeline. It taught me a lot
      about the power and flexibility of GitHub Actions for content-driven
      websites. The result is a resource that I not only use myself for language
      practice but that also serves the wider Finnish learning community.

    <h3>A Home for the Bugs</h3>
    <p>
      As my collection of Finnish learning tools grew, I realized I needed a
      central place to showcase them. That's how <code>finbug.xyz</code> was
      born. It's a simple, single-page HTML site that acts as a landing page and
      directory for projects like the Selkouutiset Archive, the Vocabulary
      Masker, and command-line tools like <code>tsk</code> and
      <code>finstem</code>. The name is a little joke—a "bug" in the sense of an
      enthusiast, as well as the six-legged kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Building this was a nice return to basics. It's just a clean, hand-written
      HTML file with some shared CSS I've developed across my other sites to
      give them a consistent look and feel. It serves its purpose perfectly: to
      be a simple, fast-loading portal for anyone interested in my language
      learning projects.

    <h3>Seeing the Shape of Words</h3>
    <p>
      This is a small but mighty tool born from a specific need in my language
      learning journey. When creating flashcards, especially for a language with
      rich morphology like Finnish, you sometimes want a hint that's more than
      nothing but less than the full answer. The Vocabulary Masker solves this
      by converting Finnish words into a "mask" that shows their structure
      (vowels, consonants, etc.) without revealing the letters themselves. For
      example, <code>uudelleen</code> might become <code>UUx~xx~~_</code>,
      helping you recall the specific synonym you're trying to practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entire application runs in the browser using plain JavaScript. It
      stores every mask you create in your browser's local storage and even lets
      you download your session as a CSV file, perfect for importing into Anki
      or another SRS program. It's a prime example of a simple tool built to
      solve one problem well.

    <h3>Gamifying Nutrition</h3>
    <p>
      This is a simple web app I built for my wife and me to track our daily
      food intake against a baseline diet. It's a no-frills checklist of common
      food items we eat, and as you check them off, it updates your total
      calorie count and daily cost in real-time. Everything is stored in local
      storage, so there's no backend—it's fast, private, and works offline.
    </p>
    <p>
      It includes a user-toggle to switch between different item lists and
      calorie targets, and a "Copy" button that formats the day's summary into
      Markdown for easy sharing or logging. It's a personal utility project that
      turned out to be a great little exercise in building a functional,
      stateful front-end application with minimal dependencies.

    <h3>Pivoting to a Commercial Product</h3>
    <p>
      Taskusanakirja represents my first real foray into building and selling a
      commercial software product. The commit history tells a story of a project
      pivoting from a potentially open-source tool into a polished,
      closed-source application. In a series of commits, I systematically
      removed all references to the GitHub repository, build-from-source
      instructions, and web server functionality, replacing them with a
      dedicated downloads page and email-only support channels. This was a
      deliberate shift to position it as a commercial product from the ground
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      A significant amount of effort went into establishing a proper legal
      framework. I spent a lot of time drafting, refactoring, and standardizing
      the EULA, Terms of Service, and Privacy Policy to be consistent and clear
      . This included defining key user-facing policies like a 30-day offline
      grace period for the Pro version and ensuring compliance with Creative
      Commons for the underlying dictionary data.
    </p>
    <h3>Focusing on Conversion and User Experience</h3>
    <p>
      With the business foundation in place, my focus shifted to the user-facing
      website and improving the download experience. I implemented a prominent,
      one-click download button that auto-detects the user's operating system to
      provide the correct binary. For the landing page, I replaced the
      traditional navigation bar with a hamburger menu to minimize distractions
      and focus attention on the download call-to-action. The downloads page
      itself was rewritten to provide comprehensive guidance for both
      non-technical and advanced users, covering everything from installation to
      Pro license activation. It's a real product now!

    <h3>Building a Professional Home</h3>
    <p>
      While my blog is my personal space, <code>siilikuin.com</code> is my
      professional one. I built it from scratch using Next.js to serve as the
      home for my software development business. The initial effort focused
      heavily on branding and aesthetics, establishing a consistent look and
      feel with an animated cloud background , the "Siilikuin" mascot, and a
      custom, accessible color system designed for WCAG AA+ contrast ratios. The
      site was built with reusable components from the start, such as a shared
      footer and call-to-action section.
    </p>
    <h3>Refining the Message</h3>
    <p>
      Over time, the site's purpose and messaging evolved significantly. It
      began with a broad focus on client work, featuring a detailed 3-phase
      client process and a headline about building software for regulated
      industries . However, I realized I wanted to shift the focus more toward
      my own products. I began a process of "toning down active client
      solicitation" by removing the "Process" page from the navigation, changing
      the messaging from shipping software to delivering "actionable technical
      roadmaps", and eventually updating the intro to clarify that Siilikuin is
      "where I build software", applying that same intro to the landing page for
      consistency.
    </p>
    <h3>Pivoting to Products and Performance</h3>
    <p>
      The final stage of its evolution (so far) has been to pivot away from
      active consulting and toward being a showcase for my commercial products,
      with Taskusanakirja being the first one featured. This also involved a
      technical pivot: I configured the Next.js app for static export and set up
      a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy it automatically to GitHub Pages. As
      part of this refinement, I also invested heavily in mobile performance,
      ultimately disabling the cloud animations entirely on mobile devices in
      favor of a static gradient to resolve scrolling issues. The site now
      serves as a lean, fast, and clear hub for my professional work and
      products.
