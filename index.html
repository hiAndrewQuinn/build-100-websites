    <h1>Build 100 Websites!</h1>
    <p>Howdy! The name's Andrew Quinn. I'm building 100 websites!</p>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It seemed like fun!</p>
    <p>I've been a computer guy for a long time, but even as a little kid I always saw building websites as this immensely daunting task that only a genius could pull off. Then I got a little older and got a computer of my own, and as the years went by it gradually began to appear like a less daunting task to me.</p>
    <p>I pretty much went through every phase of Unix geekdom you can imagine before, at the ripe age of 28, I finally admitted to myself "I just think websites are cool and I want to build some." Let's see, we have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Linux distro enthusiast phase.</li>
      <li>The Emacs enthusiast phase.</li>
      <li>The ANSI C enthusiast phase.</li>
      <li>The Haskell enthusiast phase.</li>
      <li>The bare metal enthusiast phase. (This one pushed me through a bachelor's in electrical engineering!)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And here we are. Currently I work in the ops department of a very cool fintech firm, and I'm actually quite happy with that role -- but here's my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heiandrewquinn/">LinkedIn</a> and my <a href="https://github.com/hiAndrewQuinn/">GitHub</a> profile anyway ;)</p>
    <p>I think I might be the world's slowest maturing web developer, since I got my first job in tech in 2009 as a Linux sysadmin intern at Akamai and just kind of never stopped messing around with Linux until it accidentally became my full-time career. But for some reason, I was always terrified of making the leap into <em>real</em> dev work - what if I'm not smart enough? What if I can't build the product fast enough? What if it's just a bubble? <span style="color:white;">(Yes, I was actually asking myself this about software in <em>2020</em>. Trauma is one motherfucker of a common-sense-scrambler.)</span></p>
    <h2>Website #1: <a href="https://build-100-websites.fun">https://build-100-websites.fun</a></h2>
    <p>That's right, this right here is website #1! Its primary purpose is simply as a <strong>technique catalogue</strong> of how I went about doing everything, what big technologies I used, etc. It is <em>unapologetically</em> self-indulgent that way.</p>
    <h3>Major technologies employed</h3>

    <h4>Plain ol' HTML</h4>
    <p>Ha, it's 2023 and I wrote all the HTML for this little page by hand!</p>
    <p>But it's good to get back to basics every now and then. I mean <em>really</em> basic - I've had a lot of fun nights in my life reading old websites that looked not too dissimilar at all from this, straight up Web 1.0. My favorites are when you find a professor's website that looks like it might as well be the inspiration for <a href="https://danluu.com">danluu.com</a> but then you realize it's <em>also</em> the page of one of <a href="http://www.ece.northwestern.edu/ecefaculty/Allen1.html">the most cited IEEE Fellows of all time</a>.<span style="color: white;">(Rest in peace, Dr. Taflove. I'll never forget what you did for me, and I wish I wasn't as mentally ill as I was when I was your student. Maybe I could have made something more of myself.)</span></p>
    <h4>nginx</h4>
    <p>I actually have <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=superkuh">superkuh</a> to thank for this choice. After my <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34958454">first ever Hacker News submission to hit the front page</a>, they left <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34959053">a comment</a>:
    <blockquote>
      <p>You can just write HTML too. It is much simpler, easier to maintain, and more secure (using a real webserver). Make .html files, open them in a text editor, type in the HTML. Here, I'll make an example like the minimum viable hugo.</p>

      <pre>
        $ sudo apt get install nginx
      </pre>

      <pre>
        &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
        &lt;title&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
        &lt;h1&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;html&gt;
      </pre>

      <p>And now save it as index.html in the www directory that installing nginx creates. Check it out at http://127.0.0.1/ . Go to your router and forward port 80 to the IP address of the computer running nginx to make it public.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Hey, it looked simple enough. So I tried it out. And it worked! And it was actually really fun and satisfying!</p>
    <p>Working in ops I definitely knew of <code>nginx</code> for a long time, but it always sounded like the kind of thing that was just a little too low-level for me to bother with. I think I wasn't giving it enough credit - it's quite an improvement on Apache in terms of usability. Realizing I could literally just install it, stick an <code>index.html</code> into the <code>/var/www/html/</code> it created, and then see it in Firefox has changed my tune.</p>
    <p>There was only one small problem, and that's that <code>nginx</code> doesn't use UTF-8 by default. So my ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ looked like a much more menacing Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ until I figured out how to do that:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>First find and open <code>nginx.conf</code>.
        <ol>
          <li>Any time I have to edit a random config file on a Linux box these days, I just mindlessly hammer out <code>sudo vi $(fdfind . '/' | fzf)</code> and fuzzy-search until I find the boy; it's a lot easier than trying to use my half-remembered knowledge of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard">FHS</a> to track them down.</li>
          <li>in this case, it looks like it was living at <code>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</code>.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Then find the <code>http</code> block and add <code>charset utf-8;</code> to it.</li>
      <li>Finally, run <code>systemctl reload nginx.service</code> and take a look! No more weird characters.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>entr</h4>
    <p>There was of course one annoyance even with this bare-bones setup: I didn't want to have to actually <em>edit</em> this page at <code>/var/www/html/</code>, since that's owned by root. Half the reason I love sites like <a href="http://netlify.com/">Netlify</a> is because I can just set them up to rebuild any time I hit <code>git push</code>. And <code>nginx</code> doesn't come with live reload, like Hugo does.</p>
    <p>So I installed an auto tab reloader extension for Firefox and set it to every 5 seconds, a poor man's live reload, but easy enough; and then I installed <code><a href="https://github.com/clibs/entr">entr</a></code>, a <em>magical</em> little utility that runs a shell command whenever a given file changes. (Seriously. If you've never used this thing before keep it in your back pocket. It is a game-changer when working on web stuff like this, up there with <code>watch</code> in a <code>tmux</code> window.)</p>
    <p>I went to my <code>build-100-websites</code> repo, punched in</p>
    <pre>
      echo index.html | sudo entr cp index.html /var/www/html
    </pre>
    <p>and we were off to the races!</p>
    <h4>Github Pages (hosting)</h4>
    <p>Now superkuh was kind enough to give me port forwarding instructions, but I didn't want to pay for a whole VM just to put one HTML page online. At the same time, I had used Netlify and Heroku for everything of this sort my whole life, and I decided I wanted to try out GH Pages to see what all the fuss is about. I had the literal HTML sitting there, in Github - it was even called <code>index.html</code> for crying out loud. How hard could it be?</p>
    <p>Not hard at all, it turned out! Getting it to deploy on <a href="https://hiandrewquinn.github.io/build-100-websites/">https://hiandrewquinn.github.io/build-100-websites/</a> was as close to a zero-config hosting experience as I've ever seen: Pick your branch, make sure the HTML page is named "index", and you're good.</p>
    <p>Getting it to deploy on <a href="https://build-100-websites.fun">https://build-100-websites.fun</a> was a little more involved, by necessity, since you have to set up your CNAME and ALIAS tags and everything for a DNS provider. First GH Pages commits a new <a href="https://github.com/hiAndrewQuinn/build-100-websites/blob/main/CNAME">CNAME page to the root of your Git repo</a> containing the name of your website, as per <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain">the instructions</a>.</p>
    <p>I also finally got an opportunity to use <code>dig</code>! I've wanted to use <code>dig</code> ever since I read this <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/12/04/how-to-use-dig/">Julia Evans article about it</a>.</p>

    <p>Finally I deleted the default <code>A</code> records my DNS slaps in there and added in Github Pages' own <code>A</code> and <code>AAAA</code> ones to let me go to the apex domain, <a href="https://build-100-websites.fun">build-100-websites.fun</a>, sans <code>www</code>.</p>
    <h2>Website #2: <a href="https://azure-functions-datasette.azurewebsites.net/">https://azure-functions-datasette.azurewebsites.net/</a></h2>
    <p>I know, I <em>know</em>, you were expecting me to go for Hugo for #2. But no! At work, I happened upon some CSVs generated by some legacy code that I figured woud be <em>really</em> helpful to be able to access whenever I was on the corporate network, instead of rummaging around in my email to find them ('legacy' here means, in part, that these CSVs get created and mailed out to 5 or 6 people every day).</p>
    <p>I've used Simon Willison's <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> many times before in the past and found it a simply remarkable little piece of software. I love SQLite, I love locally-hosted web apps, I love performance - what's not to love, really? But alas, the published guides on deploying Datasette all focus on <em>public</em> platforms: Google Cloud, Vercel, Fly.</p>
    <p>I happen to work primarily in enterprise, and with Microsoft Azure in particular. And I think there's a <em>really</em> nice niche for creating tiny baked-data websites for company eyes only - so I decided to get some practice at home deploying Datasette to Azure on my own time. Just to make sure I knew what I was doing for the big time. ;)</p>
    <h3>Getting Azure set up</h3>
    <p>I've never used Azure in a <em>personal</em> capacity before, despite being a cloud administrator. So I treated this quite a bit differently from how I usually provision resources on the job, namely: I aggressively cost-optimized.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Every time I performed a command, which I did entirely in the Azure Cloud Shell, I looked through the portal to find the <em>exact</em> thing I created. I wanted to be able to keep mental track of it all.</li>
      <li>Every time I came across a new feature that was mentioned, I made a few quick Anki flashcards asking me what it was and what it could give me.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Following Simon Willison's instructions, I created my resources in the order Resource Group, Storage Account, Function App. I actually really like the simplicity of this stack - it's similar to working solely with Lambdas and S3 in Amazon Web Services. Easy to keep track of.</p>
    <p>Then came the bugs! Unsurprsingly Mr Willison does not spend as much time in Azure land as me, and so his codebase was slightly out of date. The instructions weren't clear-to-the-point-of-brainless, either, so I added a few bits of my own to that. <a href="https://github.com/hiAndrewQuinn/datasette-on-azure">Here's the results!"</a>
    <h3>The cost of getting set up</h3>
    <p>After an evening or two of messing around with it, I finally got my Azure Function to work right! I was serving an honest-to-goodness serverless web app, and it wasn't even hard! For a while I loved living on the shoulders of giants... Until I saw <em>the bill.</em></p>
    <p><strong>One cent.</strong> One whole cent a day. That's how much my little experiment was costing me, and it was entirely from storage costs. I couldn't believe it! I had an actual bill that wasn't from a DNS provider, for the first time in my life!</p>
    <p>I knew from my work that storage is one of those bugbears you absolutely want to keep an eye on when running any kind of software busines, because if you're doing things right (aka collecting a lot of data), it will only grow over time - and you'd better make sure you can afford that. I found I had on the order of 50 megabytes in blob containers for my serverless SQLite database searcher, alongside about 3 MiB of tables and 6 KiB of file shares. At current prices of $0.15 per GB, this would have explained the approximately one-cent-a-day storage costs I saw. In other words, I could reliably bet on an average SQLite database, infrequently acceessed and under, say, 10 MB of data to cost about 50 cents a month.</p>
    <p>I figured this was pretty acceptable, actually, because I had another idea brewing...</p>

    <h3>Hugo to the rescue</h3>
    <p>So it won't surprise any of you to learn that I have long been a fan of <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>, especially how it can turn Markdown files into HTML files. Did you know that you can make <em>entire websites</em> like that!? Whoaaaaa. This kind of pandoc-plus software is usually called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator">static site generator, or SSG,</a> and there are even <a href="https://jamstack.org/">buzzwords around it</a> for people who like making money off of that kind of thing.</p>
    <p>SSGs are cool because sometimes a little abstraction is a good thing. Yes, we all love raw HTML around here 😼 but let's be real, if you're going to start maintaining significant amounts of actual content, you might want something that can get out of your way a little more. Ultimately I chose <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> as my SSG - I figured I only really needed to learn one, and while Hugo had a reputation for a difficult learning curve, I figured I could amortize that coist against all future sites I built with the site. (Sitting here in August 2025, I'd say I was right!)</p>
    <p>SSGs are cool because when you take the database out of the mix entirely, and only want to serve HTML, CSS, and maybe the lightest buttering of JavaScript (which I didn't even get around to on this site until like summer 2025) they can usually be literally free to operate. Like, seriously, you'd have to be some kind of idiot to screw up e.g. optimizing your GIFs so that you don't accidentally have your static site go viral on Hacker News and be buried by server bills...</p>
    <h3>I go viral on Hacker News and get buried by server bills</h3>
    <p>Oops. <a href="https://andrew-quinn.me/fzf/">https://andrew-quinn.me/fzf/</a>, published less than two months after I started the site, goes <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35248098">bonkers viral on Hacker News</a> and about a week later I learn <a href="https://andrew-quinn.me/azure/">just how Netlify, my hosting provider, made its bones.</a> In retrospect, $100 and change is an <em>incredibly cheap</em> amount to pay for that particular learning experience, and I promptly decided to actually use all of that Azure cloud knowledge I had accumulated working at <a href="https://nomentia.com/">the best cash management company in the Nordics</a> to future-proof myself with an Azure Static Web App.</p>
    <p>Success! I have never had another post from AQDM go remotely as viral as that first one, but if it ever happens again I will be ready.</p>
    <h3>Slouching towards the Long Now</h3>
    <p>My life gradually got busier after 2023. I switched jobs to a senior position at another company, and this tiny digital cottage of mine languished with barely any content since then. Virtually nothing on the blog actually happened in 2024. Virtually nothing on the blog actually happened in 2024. A second burst of activity in 2025 while I was on paid parental leave with my firstborn child led me to have to face the facts: I really wanted a digital home, but I didn't have much of a clue for what I would actually want to <em>do</em> there.</p>
    <p>So I decided, ultimately, that this was going to be a slim, slowly-updating website about <em>me</em>, as a personal human being. I have other websites now for any technological work I want to publicize; I want this website to slowly grow into a sprawling morass of essays and personal reflections, that the reader can walk away from thinking about things in a new light. (I am very, very far from that goal, but that is my intention!)</p>
